# Summary of Statistical Concepts

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

-   OLS has a geometric interpretation where the goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals.
-   In Simple Linear Regression (SLR), the OLS and MLE methods produce the same estimates, showcasing their equivalence in this context.

## Relationships Between Distributions

-   The square of the t-distribution ($t^2$) follows an F-distribution, illustrating the connections between different statistical distributions and their roles in hypothesis testing.

## Gamma Function

-   The Gamma function is fundamental in defining distributions like the Chi-square and F-distributions.
-   These functions are key to understanding the mathematical foundations of many statistical tests.

## Partial F-Test

-   In Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), the Partial F-Test is valuable for testing the significance of a subset of variables.
-   It allows for comparison between different models and is a more nuanced approach within MLR.

## Uniform Distribution

-   The simplicity of the Uniform distribution makes it a versatile tool for generating other distributions and models in statistical analysis.

## Bayes' Theorem and Its Applications

-   Bayes' Theorem is crucial in techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Naive Bayes.
-   It is especially influential in probabilistic modeling and classification tasks.

## F-Test and t-test in Simple Linear Regression

-   $t^2$=FThe F-test assesses the overall significance of the regression model, whereas the t-test is often used to evaluate individual coefficients, particularly in one-sided tests.

## Understanding Hypothesis Tests

-   Each hypothesis test has its own specific interpretation, aiding in the meaningful analysis of data.
-   The philosophy behind tests like the F-test is grounded in the shape and properties of the underlying distribution.
-   Understanding the connections between these tests and more familiar ones (like the Z-test) can clarify their significance and application.



## Tailor series and homoscedasticity in regression analysis

tailor series helps to diagnose non-linearity in the neighborhood. If the second-derivative of talor is not zero evn the third. We should consider higher ......
