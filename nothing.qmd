# 1. Regression Models

## One Individual's Data
For one individual $z_1, \dots, z_p$, the failure time $t_i$, the failure rate (intensity):

$$
\lambda(t \mid z_i) = \exp(z_i^T \beta) \times \lambda_0(t)
$$

Where $z_i$ represents the variables of the individual $i$, and $\beta$ is a vector of coefficients.

## Proportional Hazard Assumption
Under the proportional hazard assumption, the hazard ratio between different individuals remains constant over time:

$$
\frac{\lambda(t \mid z_i)}{\lambda(t \mid z_j)} = \exp((z_i - z_j)^T \beta)
$$

## Likelihood Function
The likelihood function $L(\beta)$ for the hazard rate for censored data is:

$$
L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \left[\lambda(t_i \mid z_i)\right]^{\delta_i} \exp \left( - \int_0^{t_i} \lambda(s \mid z_i) ds \right)
$$

For censored data:

$$
\delta_i = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if event observed (uncensored)} \\ 
0 & \text{if censored} 
\end{cases}
$$

Thus, the partial likelihood function $L_P(\beta)$ is:

$$
L_P(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\exp(z_i^T \beta)}{\sum_{j \in R(t_i)} \exp(z_j^T \beta)}
$$

Where $R(t_i)$ is the set of individuals at risk at time $t_i$.

# 2. Product-Limit Method for Censored Data

Assume $n$ independent individuals. The survival probability is modeled as:

$$
S(t) = P(T \geq t) = \prod_{j: t_j \leq t} \left(1 - \frac{d_j}{Y_j} \right)
$$

Where:

- $d_j$ is the number of failures at time $t_j$,
- $Y_j$ is the number of individuals at risk just before time $t_j$.

For censored data, the hazard rate:

$$
\lambda_j = \frac{d_j}{Y_j}
$$

The likelihood function from MLE is then:

$$
L = \prod_{j=1}^{k} \left( \frac{d_j}{Y_j} \right)^{d_j} \left( 1 - \frac{d_j}{Y_j} \right)^{Y_j - d_j}
$$

# 1. Log-Rank Test (2-Sample)

## Overview
- **Slight advantage**: Is it significant enough? Maybe within the noise.
- **At first glance**: This can be seen as a $t$-test (2-sample), where censoring $\to X$.

## Table for Seamlessly Handling with Ties

|      | Group 1 | Group 2 | Total  |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Died | $d_{1k}$| $d_{2k}$| $d_k$  |
| Survived |       |         |        |
| Total| $r_{1k}$| $r_{2k}$| $r_k$  |

- $d_k$: death time.
- $r_k$: number at risk at time $t_k$.
- $d_{1k}$ and $d_{2k}$: number of deaths in group 1 and group 2 respectively.

To test the hypothesis $H_0$: No difference between survival curves:

$$
E(X_k) = \frac{r_{1k}}{r_k} d_k
$$

The test statistic:

$$
W = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} (X_k - E(X_k))}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X_k)}}
$$

Where:

$$
\text{Var}(X_k) = \frac{r_{1k} r_{2k} d_k (r_k - d_k)}{r_k^2 (r_k - 1)}
$$

And under $H_0$:

$$
W \sim N(0,1)
$$

From this, the $p$-value is calculated to determine the significance.

# 2. Cox (1972)

## Failure Time
Consider the failure time $T$ (discrete or continuous random variable). Define the survival function as:

$$
S(t) = P(T \geq t) = 1 - F(t)
$$

Where $F(t)$ is the distribution function.

### Discrete Case
The failure rate $\lambda$ is defined as:

$$
\lambda(t_k) = \frac{P(t_k \leq T < t_{k+1} \mid T \geq t_k)}{h_k} = \frac{f(t_k)}{S(t_k)}
$$

For the continuous case, the hazard function is:

$$
\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t + \Delta t \mid T \geq t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
$$

Thus, the relationship between the hazard function and the survival function is:

$$
\lambda(t) = -\frac{d}{dt} \log S(t)
$$

Which implies:

$$
S(t) = e^{-\int_0^t \lambda(u) du}
$$

### Likelihood and Censoring
For censored data, the likelihood function becomes:

$$
L = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \lambda(t_i) \right]^{\delta_i} \left[ S(t_i) \right]^{1 - \delta_i}
$$

Where $\delta_i = 1$ if the event is observed and $\delta_i = 0$ if censored.
